# Hopper
Hello! My name is Katelyn Biesiadecki. Currently, I am a high school senior at La Canada High School. I created this 3D game for a computer science class at Cal State LA (CS454, Advanced Topics in Computer Science a.k.a. 3D Game Programming). It was a really great class, and I felt like a learned a lot from this experience.

Have fun! Be sure to download Panda3D before cloning this repo.

## Storyline
One summer day, a boy named Hopper and his best friend are sailing at sea when a massive storm hits. 
They are stranded at sea, feeling hopeless and abandoned, until a wizard appears and returns Hopper home -- on the condition that the wizard takes his best friend, unbeknowst to Hopper. 
Now, Hopper must climb up the treacherous wizardâ€™s staircase to his lair to rescue his friend.
