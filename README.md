Hello! My name is Katelyn Biesiadecki. Currently, I am a high school senior at La Canada High School. I created this 3D game for a computer science class at Cal State LA (CS454, Advanced Topics in Computer Science a.k.a. 3D Game Programming). It was a really great class, and I felt like a learned a lot from this experience.

Have fun! Be sure to download Panda3D before cloning this repo.
